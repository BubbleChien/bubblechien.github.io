		XBox Talk redirects the XBox central button to a key, allowing it to 
		be used for push to talk.<br/>
		<br/>
		Most standard keys are supported, however some are disabled (keys with 
		special functions or likely to be already in use).<br/>
		<br/>
		Current version is 0.9, is has been tested on Windows 7 (x64) with an 
		XBox360 Controller.<br/>
